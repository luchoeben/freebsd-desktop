# freebsd-desktop
Script to setup a FreeBSD machine for desktopuse


This script is meant to be run once after a fresh installation of
FreeBSD. It will do an update of the system, install a lot of packages
and setup some stuff you could like to have on a desktop machine such as
languagesettings, tmp-cleanup, anacron, powerd, ntp etc.

At the moment the script will install a desktop based on KDE
